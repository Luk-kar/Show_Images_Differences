## Getting Started üí°

![how_program_works](https://github.com/Lukkar90/UI-Photoshop-toolSet/blob/master/docs/images/how_program_works.png)

Find **Reference-Judge.exe** in the folder or run through **python Reference_Judge** command line  in the directory where the folder exists

To run UI version you don't have to provide any arguments, just press "enter"
![terminal program no args](https://github.com/Lukkar90/UI-Photoshop-toolSet/blob/master/docs/images/terminal_program_no_args.png)

If you want to use the console, click here -> [**How to use console**](https://github.com/Lukkar90/UI-Photoshop-toolSet/blob/master/docs/images/How_to_use_console)

#### When UI version started

![main window](https://github.com/Lukkar90/UI-Photoshop-toolSet/blob/master/docs/images/MainWindow.png)

Firstly, you choose the **source** folder/file/url to **process**  
Next, you choose the **target** folder/file/url to **compare** to
Later, you check **mode** in which you want to display images:

- **Save**
- **Show**

In **save mode** you choose the folder in which your matches will be saved
To do that you have to provide a **path** in the **output dialog** box

When a name should be the **same as in source**, provide the output path as a **folder**
When a name should be **specified**, provide the output path as a **file**

In **show mode** there will be automatically displayed matched images
To go to the next set of images press **"0"** key

The **width** dialog is responsible for the size in which images will be rendered
minimal value is **0**, maximal value is **1080** mainly for performance reasons

The checkbox **Search by the ratio** enables searching similar images with different sizes but with the same ratio
sizes of **original** image compared to **target** image are from **0.5** to **4.0** times
any ratios of **target** images below or above this values are disregarded
Generally, it's not recommended to use this option due to image distortions

The final step is to push the button **"Match images"**
Depending on a number of images to process results should appear fairly fast
Images are automatically **matched** on the degree of **similarity**
The **naming** of files does **not matter** in that case

Enjoy the results!

### Errors

If you use **save mode**:
When **errors occur**, then it will be **created .txt** file where **errors** are **stored**
**.txt** file is **stored** in the selected folder **in output** folder
Each **.txt** file looks like: **ERROR-(date when the script ran)**:

If you use **show mode**:
You will only get pop-up notification about the quantity of **errors**

Type of **errors**:
- When there is no match for **source** image among **target** images
- When image **matched** is not saved

### Setup

![setup menu](https://github.com/Lukkar90/UI-Photoshop-toolSet/blob/master/docs/images/setup.png)

The areas marked **in red** are **options** which can be **saved**, **load**
Default place where setups are stored are **"program/data/appData/"**

- **Save as** save current setup into **.ini** file
- **Open** open setup **.ini** file
- **Save to defaults** save current setup as **defaults** (**load that** setup each time when **program starts**)
- **Reset to defaults** load **defaults**
- **Defaults reset** overwrite **defaults** to **standard** values and **load** them

### Logs

![logs menu](https://github.com/Lukkar90/UI-Photoshop-toolSet/blob/master/docs/images/logs.png)

In this place, you can choose if logs are saved or not
